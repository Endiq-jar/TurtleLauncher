/**
 * TurtleLauncher: one-tap install for a small curated set of performance mods and a
 * resource pack, requested by name rather than built from a general mod browser.
 *
 * Real, verified Modrinth project slugs (checked July 2026, not guessed):
 *  - Sodium         -> "sodium"
 *  - Lithium        -> "lithium"
 *  - Entity Culling -> "entityculling"
 *  - Indium         -> "indium"       (Sodium's own Fabric Rendering API shim)
 *  - Bare Bones     -> "bare-bones"   (resource pack, not loader-specific)
 *
 * "For every loader" doesn't need a per-loader slug table: each of these projects tags
 * its own versions with the loaders it supports, so passing the instance's actual
 * [ModLoader] through to Modrinth's version API resolves the right build automatically
 * (or correctly comes back with nothing on a loader the mod was never built for, e.g.
 * plain Forge - none of these four ship a Forge build under these names; that's real,
 * not a bug here, and is reported as such rather than silently skipped).
 *
 * Two things worth knowing before this list is taken at face value:
 *  1. Sodium's own compatibility notes call out Android GL-translation layers (GL4ES,
 *     ANGLE-style wrappers) as unsupported with "severe performance issues" - it's
 *     built and tested against real desktop GL/native GLES. It tends to work fine
 *     through this launcher's Vulkan Zink or MobileGlues renderers (both talk closer
 *     to native GL/Vulkan than a CPU translation layer does), but is a poor match for
 *     the GL4ES-family renderers specifically. Surfaced in the install result, not
 *     silently hidden.
 *  2. Indium is Sodium's OWN compatibility shim from before Sodium had built-in Fabric
 *     Rendering API support, and Sodium 0.6.0+ ships that support natively - the two
 *     are explicitly incompatible past that point. Installing both unconditionally
 *     would break the mod set is was meant to help. So: resolve Sodium first, and only
 *     install Indium if the resolved Sodium build is older than 0.6.0.
