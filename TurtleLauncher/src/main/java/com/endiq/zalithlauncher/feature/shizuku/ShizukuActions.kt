/**
 * TurtleLauncher: the concrete things this launcher can do *only* with Shizuku.
 *
 * Everything here is best-effort by design. What an ADB-shell (uid 2000) or root (uid 0)
 * process may do differs per Android version and per ROM, and a command failing is normal -
 * e.g. `renice` to a negative priority needs CAP_SYS_NICE, which the ADB shell user does not
 * have on a user build. None of these failures are errors in this launcher; the UI reports
 * each one honestly rather than claiming success.
 *
 * Every function must be called off the main thread (they block on shell I/O).
