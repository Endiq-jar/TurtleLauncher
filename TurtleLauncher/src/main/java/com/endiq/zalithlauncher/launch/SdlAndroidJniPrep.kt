/**
 * SDL initialization when it needs to be done from JNI.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: starting with Minecraft 26.3 (SDL 3), SDL creates its EGL window surface
 * from the game thread on its own, without an Android Surface being passed in first. SDL
 * therefore needs the host Activity, the SDLSurface instance and the native surface handle to
 * already be set up on the ART side when the JNI calls start. Amethyst solves this with a native
 * `sdl_hook.c` that patches `SDL_InitSubSystem()` and calls `CallbackBridge.notifyLauncher()`,
 * which then runs SDLActivity's setup on demand.
 *
 * WHAT IS AND ISN'T PORTED: TurtleLauncher ships `libpojavexec.so` prebuilt with no native
 * sources and no NDK toolchain here, so the `sdl_hook.c` half cannot be ported. What this class
 * does instead is mirror Amethyst's ART-side setup sequence, executed ahead of time on the host
 * side just before the JVM starts (from JREUtils.launchJavaVM). `setupJNI()`'s `()I` signature
 * is kept - Amethyst's `nativeSetupJNI()` returns void, but this build's libSDL3.so registers
 * the `()I` variant and a mismatched signature aborts on the first call. Amethyst also calls
 * `SDLActivity.getSDLSurface().nativeResize(...)` on size changes; this launcher's libSDL3.so
 * exports no `nativeResize` (checked in the binary), so resizes go through
 * SDLSurface.surfaceChanged() instead - see MinecraftGLSurface.notifySdlOfSurfaceSize().
 *
 * STATUS: the previously *confirmed* abort (jar/.so `nativeSetupJNI` signature mismatch) stays
 * fixed. The original SIGSEGV this class exists to prevent is NOT confirmed fixed - this
 * environment has no device or emulator to test on, and the native half of Amethyst's fix is
 * the part that could not be ported. Treat "26.3 launches" as unverified until it runs on a
 * real device; CrashAnalyzer's rule 22 says the same thing to the user when this path crashes.
