/**
 * Groups the flat Mojang version manifest into per-series buckets for the version-card
 * screen: one card per major.minor series (e.g. "1.21", "26.2"), each containing every
 * release/snapshot/pre-release/rc that belongs to it, plus dedicated Beta and Alpha cards
 * for the pre-1.0 eras (those don't have a meaningful numeric series of their own).
 *
 * Series membership is derived from the version id string itself, not a lookup table
 * Mojang doesn't publish one - so it only works when the id actually encodes its target
 * series. That covers every id shape actually seen in this game's manifest:
 *   - "1.21.4"            (release)               -> series "1.21"
 *   - "26.2"               (release, 2-segment)     -> series "26.2"
 *   - "1.21.4-pre1"/"-rc1" (pre-release/RC)         -> series "1.21"
 *   - "26.3 Snapshot 4"    (this game's snapshot naming - the series is spelled out) -> "26.3"
 * Anything that doesn't match one of those shapes (old week-coded snapshot names with no
 * version number in them at all, like real Minecraft's historical "24w14a") can't be
 * mapped to a series from the id alone and is deliberately left out of the numbered-series
 * grouping rather than guessed at - see [ungroupedSnapshots].
