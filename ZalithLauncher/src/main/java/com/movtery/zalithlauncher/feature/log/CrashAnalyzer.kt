/**
 * TurtleLauncher Crash & Log Analyzer.
 *
 * Looks at the launcher's "latestlog.txt" (and, if available, Minecraft's own
 * crash-report file) and tries to recognise known failure signatures, surfacing a
 * plain-language cause + a concrete checklist of fixes instead of a raw stack trace.
 *
 * This is intentionally *not* a generic log-parsing framework: it is a small,
 * hand-maintained knowledge base of patterns we've actually seen cause real crashes
 * on Android (native library loading, renderer driver bugs, OOM, broken/incompatible
 * mods, corrupted downloads, auth issues...). New patterns can be added to [rules]
 * as they're discovered.
 *
 * Used from two places:
 *  - After the game process exits with a non-zero code (a real "crash"), via
 *    [analyzeGameExit], wired into JREUtils → ErrorActivity.
 *  - While the game process is still alive but appears stuck (a "black screen" that
 *    never crashes), via [analyzeFrozenState], wired into [GameWatchdog].
