/**
 * TurtleLauncher: system-side (logcat) capture of a game session.
 *
 * Why this exists: every crash screen in this launcher reads its raw log from
 * `latestlog.txt`, which is written by the NATIVE side (`net.kdt.pojavlaunch.Logger
 * .appendToLog`) from inside the JVM that is running Minecraft. When the game dies the way
 * it most often dies on real devices - a SIGSEGV/SIGABRT in the renderer, an OOM kill, an
 * ANR kill - that process is gone instantly. Whatever was still sitting in the native
 * logger's buffer is gone with it, so `latestlog.txt` is frequently EMPTY (or truncated
 * mid-line) at exactly the moment you need it. That is the "logs didn't appear" half of the
 * support reports: the crash screen opened, but there was nothing in it.
 *
 * logcat does not have that problem. It is a kernel buffer owned by logd, not by the dying
 * process, so everything the game (and the launcher, and the renderer) printed survives the
 * crash and can be read afterwards. An app is always allowed to read its OWN log lines
 * (everything sharing its UID - which here means the `:launcher`, `:game` and
 * `:gui_installer` processes), with no permission needed. `READ_LOGS` would be required to
 * read other apps' lines, and nothing here needs that.
 *
 * So this runs `logcat` as a live drain into a rolling file for the duration of a session,
 * and offers a synchronous one-shot dump for when a session is already over. Both are
 * cross-process safe: the file lives under [PathManager.DIR_LAUNCHER_LOG], which every
 * process of this app resolves to the same path, so the `:game` process can write it and
 * ErrorActivity (which runs in the `:launcher` process) can read it back.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a replacement for CrashAnalyzer/ErrorActivity - it is a
 * *fallback source of raw log text* for them, used only when `latestlog.txt` has nothing.
