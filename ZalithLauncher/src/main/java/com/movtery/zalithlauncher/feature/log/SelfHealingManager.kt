/**
 * TurtleLauncher Self-Healing Launcher (roadmap #9).
 *
 * Turns Crash Analyzer 2.0's existing one-click [CrashAnalyzer.RepairAction] system from
 * "tap to fix" into "fixed automatically" — but only for the diagnoses that actually carry
 * a repair action, i.e. only issues CrashAnalyzer is already concretely certain about (a
 * corrupted file, a broken renderer override, missing assets, a broken Java runtime...).
 * Diagnoses with no repair action (unrecognised causes, mod-conflict warnings, the AI
 * fallback suggestion) are never touched — self-healing only ever acts on things Crash
 * Analyzer already knows how to fix, it never guesses.
 *
 * This is deliberately just an automatic-invocation layer on top of [CrashAnalyzer.executeRepair]
 * — it doesn't reimplement any repair logic itself, so every safety scoping already built into
 * the individual repair actions (corrupted-file delete confined to the game folder, permission
 * fixes confined to specific known folders, config restoration only for zero-byte/unparsable
 * files, etc.) applies here exactly as it does to the manual "Fix it" button. Nothing here can
 * touch worlds, screenshots, accounts, or anything outside what executeRepair itself scopes to.
