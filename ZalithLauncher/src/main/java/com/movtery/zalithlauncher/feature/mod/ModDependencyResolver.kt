/**
 * Auto dependency installer.
 *
 * Looks at every parsed mod's own declared dependencies (see [ModInfo.getDependencies],
 * populated by ModParser from fabric.mod.json/quilt.mod.json/mods.toml), figures out
 * which mandatory dependency mod IDs aren't actually present among the installed mods,
 * and tries to download a matching jar straight from Modrinth into the mods folder.
 *
 * Entirely best-effort: a dependency we can't find/identify on Modrinth (its mod ID
 * often doesn't match its Modrinth slug exactly) is simply reported as unresolved —
 * never throws, never blocks the rest of the launch.
 *
 * A disabled mod (renamed to *.jar.disabled, see [ModUtils]) is intentionally left out
 * of [ModInfo] parsing, so on its own this resolver can't tell "genuinely missing" apart
 * from "player disabled/deleted it on purpose" — every dependent mod's jar would just
 * look like it's missing sodium again on the next launch and get a fresh copy installed,
 * piling up duplicate jars of the same mod ID until Fabric refuses to load. The ledger
 * below is what makes that distinction: it remembers what this resolver installed and
 * where, so a disabled copy is left alone and an outright-deleted one is never replaced.
