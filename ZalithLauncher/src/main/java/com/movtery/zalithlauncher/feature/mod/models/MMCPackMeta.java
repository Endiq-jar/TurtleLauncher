/**
 * POJO for a MultiMC/PrismLauncher instance export's mmc-pack.json. Real, external,
 * documented format (meta.multimc.org / meta.prismlauncher.org both publish components
 * under these exact uids) - not invented for this launcher. Unlike CurseForge/Modrinth's
 * manifests, this carries no Mojang-format version.json and no list of mods to download -
 * a MultiMC export already has the actual .minecraft-equivalent content (mods/saves/
 * configs/resourcepacks/etc) sitting in the zip, so importing means: extract that content,
 * then hand the version+loader found here to TurtleLauncher's normal installer pipeline
 * the same way every other modpack type in this package does.
