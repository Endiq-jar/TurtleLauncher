/**
 * TurtleLauncher: runs a shell command with Shizuku's privilege (root, or the ADB shell user).
 *
 * ### Why the reflection
 * `Shizuku.newProcess(String[], String[], String)` is the only part of the Shizuku API that
 * spawns a shell process, and in Shizuku-API 13.1.5 (the version this integrates against) it
 * is **private** - it was hidden ahead of its planned removal in API v14, while the returned
 * [rikka.shizuku.ShizukuRemoteProcess] type stayed public. It is therefore not reachable at
 * compile time, so it is called reflectively here and typed as a plain [Process].
 *
 * That is deliberate rather than a shortcut: the documented, future-proof route is a Shizuku
 * "user service" (bindUserService + a generated AIDL Stub), which is a much larger surface -
 * an .aidl source set, a generated interface, a manifest entry and asynchronous bind
 * lifecycle - for what is here a handful of short-lived commands. Keeping the risky part in
 * one small, loudly-commented function means that if Shizuku removes the method outright,
 * the failure is contained to this file (every caller degrades to "unavailable" instead of
 * crashing), and the swap to a user service is a single-function change.
 *
 * Nothing here throws: a failed command is reported through [ShizukuShell.Result].
