/**
 * Shared text-only filtering for gallery tile labels ([LittleSkinGalleryApi] and, where a
 * label exists, [LabyModGalleryApi]). Two separate, honest limitations up front:
 *
 * 1. [isBlockedName] is a keyword blocklist against the uploader-given skin/cape *name* text
 *    only. It cannot look at the actual texture pixels - nothing in this project has an image
 *    classifier, and building one is well outside a "fix the gallery" ask. A skin with an
 *    innocuous name and an offensive texture, or vice versa, will not be caught either way.
 *    This only ever removes a tile; it never rewrites or "cleans" one.
 * 2. [toDisplayLabel] does not translate anything - there's no translation API wired into this
 *    project (would need a real key/service, e.g. Google Cloud Translation, none of which is
 *    configured here). What it actually does is detect labels that aren't representable in
 *    Latin script and swap them for a neutral placeholder, the same way [LabyModGalleryApi]
 *    already falls back to a hash prefix when it has no name at all. That keeps every visible
 *    label in English text, but a Chinese/Japanese/Korean/etc. skin name becomes "Skin #123",
 *    not an actual English translation of what the uploader called it.
