/**
 * Live browsing of LabyMod's public laby.net skin library (laby.net/skins) as an actual
 * *gallery* source - a grid of real, arbitrary community skins the user can page through and
 * tap to apply - rather than [LabyModSkinApi]'s per-player lookup, which only ever resolves
 * "this one player's current skin", or [SkinCapeHistoryStore]'s local "recently applied" list.
 *
 * laby.net doesn't publish a documented public JSON API for this (that's why the two classes
 * above exist and predate this one - see their doc comments). What's used here instead is
 * everything a plain browser hitting laby.net already gets, no auth/private endpoints:
 *
 *  - Gallery pages are plain, crawlable URLs - `laby.net/skins/tag/{tag}` for a tag (e.g. the
 *    site's own default "Trending" view), or `laby.net/skins?input={query}` for the site's
 *    unified search box (confirmed live: `laby.net/skins?input=LabyMod`).
 *  - The page is Next.js App Router. The grid renders client-side, but the data driving it
 *    ships inline in the *initial* HTML response as the React Server Components "flight"
 *    payload (`<script>self.__next_f.push([1,"..."])</script>` blocks) so the page can
 *    hydrate without a second round-trip - it's present in the raw response body even though
 *    nothing turns it into visible text. [scrapeSkinHashes] pulls skin hashes straight out of
 *    that payload by keying off `imageHash` (confirmed as the real field/route-param name -
 *    laby.net's own Sentry transaction tag for the skin detail route is literally
 *    `GET /[locale]/skins/[imageHash]`). If a future laby.net deploy changes shape and that
 *    comes up empty, it falls back to a plain `/skins/{hash}` link scan of the whole body -
 *    weaker (misses tiles that never got a plain link) but far more layout-resilient.
 *  - Thumbnails use laby.net's own confirmed render API - the exact one laby.net's own
 *    `<meta og:image>` tags use on every skin page: `laby.net/api/v3/render/skin/{hash}.png`.
 *  - There's no confirmed raw-texture (flat 64-wide) endpoint the way there's a confirmed
 *    render one - laby.net's page metadata never references one directly. [resolveApplyTexture]
 *    tries the most REST-idiomatic guesses first (a resource at the same path as the known-good
 *    render endpoint, minus `/render/`), then falls back to scraping the skin's own detail page
 *    for any embedded `.png` URL that *isn't* a `/render/` URL - the site's Skin Editor has to
 *    load the real flat texture from somewhere to let you paint on it and export a 64x64 PNG,
 *    so that URL exists in that page's own flight payload too. Every candidate is downloaded
 *    and decoded before being accepted - real Minecraft skins are always exactly 64px wide, so
 *    a wrong guess is rejected instead of silently applying a corrupted/wrong image.
