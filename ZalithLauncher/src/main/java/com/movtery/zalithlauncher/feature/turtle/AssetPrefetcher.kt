/**
 * TurtleLauncher v10: while the user is sitting on the main menu (version list),
 * this warms the on-disk/Glide caches for every version's icon file and touches
 * each version's mods folder listing, so switching to a version or opening its
 * mod list doesn't pay a cold-cache cost the first time. Deliberately cheap and
 * best-effort — any failure for one version is skipped, never surfaced to the UI.
 *
 * Runs its worker threads at Process.THREAD_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND: this work is pure
 * "nice to have if the CPU is free" - on a low-end device where the UI thread and any
 * running renderer/game threads are already fighting for cycles, this keeps prefetching
 * from ever being the reason a tap feels delayed.
