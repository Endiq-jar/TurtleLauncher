/**
 * TurtleLauncher: "Background Services" (spec item 20) - while Minecraft is running,
 * TaskExecutors.isGameSessionActive already deprioritizes the shared task-pool's OS
 * thread priority (Section 3, CPU Optimizations). This adds the remaining concrete
 * pieces the spec asks for on top of that same flag, all traced to real call sites
 * rather than invented ones:
 *
 *  - Pause unnecessary animations: FragmentWithAnim.playAnimation() now short-circuits
 *    on isGameSessionActive, same as the user's own "disable animations" toggle.
 *  - Pause update checker: PluginLoader's passive plugin-update network check (which
 *    genuinely re-fires every session, since MainActivity's :game process re-runs
 *    BaseActivity.onCreate()) now skips while a session is active.
 *  - Pause indexing: AssetPrefetcher's version-wide directory-listing pass now refuses
 *    to start a new run while a session is active.
 *  - Reduce launcher RAM usage: this file's onGameSessionStart() evicts Glide's
 *    in-memory bitmap cache (version icons, backgrounds, mod-list thumbnails) right
 *    before Minecraft starts, freeing that RAM for the game. Self-restoring by
 *    construction - Glide simply repopulates the cache lazily the next time an
 *    ImageView asks for something, same as the existing onLowMemory() handling in
 *    PojavApplication already relies on.
 *  - Lower launcher CPU priority: already covered by TaskExecutors' existing
 *    beforeExecute() override; nothing further to add without touching the main
 *    thread's own priority, which isn't safe to lower out from under a launcher the
 *    user might switch back to at any moment.
 *  - Restore automatically after exit: nothing here needs an explicit restore step -
 *    every gate above simply stops applying the instant isGameSessionActive flips back
 *    to false in LauncherActivity.onResume(), and the Glide cache heals itself on next
 *    use. onGameSessionEnd() exists as the symmetric call site for any future addition
 *    that *does* need one.
