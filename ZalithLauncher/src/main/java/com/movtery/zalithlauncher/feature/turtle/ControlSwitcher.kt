/**
 * TurtleLauncher "Control Switcher": tap a button, get the next control layout.
 *
 * This is the same operation the in-game menu already offers under
 * Game Menu -> Control -> "Replace Control Layout" (MainActivity.replacementCustomControls(),
 * which opens SelectControlsDialog) - but with the dialog removed, for people who swap layouts
 * mid-game (e.g. a building layout and a PvP layout) and don't want to open the drawer for it.
 *
 * Layouts are the .json files in [PathManager.DIR_CTRLMAP_PATH], the same directory
 * ControlsListViewCreator lists, sorted by name so the cycle order is stable and predictable.
 * Cycling wraps: after the last layout it comes back to the first. The layout that is active
 * right now is read from [ControlLayout.mLayoutFileName], which loadLayout() sets, so the
 * switcher stays correct even if the layout was chosen through the menu or the editor instead.
 *
 * The button that calls this lives in activity_game.xml (control_switcher_button) and is
 * shown/hidden by AllSettings.controlSwitcherEnabled, toggled in the in-game menu as
 * "Control Switcher".
