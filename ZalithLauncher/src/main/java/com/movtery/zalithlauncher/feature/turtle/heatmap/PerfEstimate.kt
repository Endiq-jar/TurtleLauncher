/**
 * TurtleLauncher: how heavy a mod/resource pack/shader pack is *likely* to be.
 *
 * IMPORTANT HONESTY NOTE: nothing here is a measured FPS number. This sandbox has no
 * device to actually run Minecraft on and profile, so [HeatmapAnalyzer] never invents
 * one either - "-12fps" style numbers would be fabricated, not estimated. What it does
 * instead is static-analyze the file itself for real, well-known correlates of runtime
 * cost (declared Mixin count for mods, render-pass count for shader packs, decoded
 * texture memory for resource packs) and bucket those into a tier. Treat the tier as a
 * "worth a second look" signal, not a guarantee.
