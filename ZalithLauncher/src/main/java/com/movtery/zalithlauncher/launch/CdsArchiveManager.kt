/**
 * TurtleLauncher CDS (Class Data Sharing) support.
 *
 * A cold Minecraft JVM start spends real, measurable time re-parsing, re-verifying
 * and re-linking the same few thousand classes every single launch - worse on
 * Android than on desktop, since storage is slower and cores are weaker. CDS lets
 * the JVM dump a pre-parsed/pre-verified snapshot of the classes it loaded and
 * mmap that back in on the next run instead of redoing the work from scratch.
 * This was previously entirely unused by the launcher.
 *
 * Two strategies depending on what the runtime supports:
 *  - Java 19+: a single self-maintaining flag pair, -XX:+AutoCreateSharedArchive,
 *    which creates the archive on the first run and silently refreshes it whenever
 *    it's missing or stale. No manual bookkeeping needed.
 *  - Java 17 (still required for MC 1.18-1.20.4): AutoCreateSharedArchive doesn't
 *    exist yet, so the two-phase dance is managed by hand here -
 *    ArchiveClassesAtExit on the run that has no archive, SharedArchiveFile on
 *    every run after.
 *  - Java 8: Dynamic CDS Archives don't exist at all (added in JDK 13); skipped.
 *
 * One archive per (runtime, Minecraft version) pair, since the class set loaded
 * differs per version and mod loader. If the JVM can't use a given archive for any
 * reason (missing, corrupt, wrong base archive) it just logs a warning internally
 * and launches without it - this is purely an optimization, never a launch
 * blocker, by design of the underlying JVM flags themselves.
