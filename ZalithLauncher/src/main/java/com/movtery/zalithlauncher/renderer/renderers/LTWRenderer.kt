/**
 * LTW ("Large Thin Wrapper", self-reported as "OpenLTW" in its own version string) -
 * MojoLauncher's own renderer (github.com/MojoLauncher/LTW), actively maintained there
 * (MojoLauncher's changelog references LTW updates as recently as its 20260326 build,
 * e.g. "Updated LTW for improved 1.21.7+ performance"). Not to be confused with a
 * standalone GL4ES-style translator: `nm -D` on the bundled libltw.so shows it exports
 * only ~120 specific desktop-GL entry points (glDrawElementsBaseVertex, glTexBuffer,
 * glBlendFunciSEPARATE, buffer-storage calls, MultiDraw*, etc.) plus eglGetProcAddress -
 * no glClear/glDrawArrays/eglGetDisplay/eglInitialize at all. Its own log strings confirm
 * the design: "LTWInit: failed loading custom libEGL, using default" - it dlopens the
 * real system EGL/GLESv2 itself at init and serves as a thin interposer in front of it,
 * patching in the handful of desktop-GL-3.x-shaped calls a plain mobile GLES driver
 * usually lacks (the "3.3" in its "3.3 OpenLTW" version string is the GL version it makes
 * the game see), forwarding everything else straight through via its own
 * eglGetProcAddress. That's architecturally identical to how Holy GL4ES/Krypton Wrapper
 * are wired here (own translation .so + system libEGL.so), not the ANGLE-paired setup its
 * name suggests from the FCLRendererPlugin release notes ("ANGLE/LTW") - MojoLauncher's
 * own GitHub issue tracker confirms "OpenLTW" is selectable as its own standalone
 * renderer, independent of the ANGLE toggle.
 *
 * No unique identifier to copy from FCL's RendererManager.kt here - current
 * FCL-Team/FoldCraftLauncher upstream doesn't have LTW as a built-in at all (checked
 * directly; it's still plugin-only there too), so getUniqueIdentifier() below is a
 * freshly generated UUID, not lifted from an existing source of truth.
 *
 * Version note: the bundled libltw.so reports "Built on: Jul 13 2026" - newer than the
 * LTW-2025.7.16.apk asset on ShirosakiMio/FCLRendererPlugin's own "Renderer" release
 * (dated Jul 2025, over a year stale), so that release would be a downgrade. LTW has no
 * other versioned distribution channel (MojoLauncher/LTW builds straight to an AAR from
 * source, no tagged releases) - the bundled build is already the newest available.
