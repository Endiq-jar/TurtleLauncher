/**
 * TurtleLauncher: Zstandard-backed compression for launcher-owned disk caches.
 *
 * com.github.luben:zstd-jni was already a declared dependency (real prebuilt native libs for
 * all 4 Android ABIs, confirmed via web search before relying on it) but had never actually been
 * wired into anything - this is that wiring, finally used for real.
 *
 * Only use this for files this codebase both writes AND reads itself (e.g. the mod-info parse
 * cache) - never for anything Minecraft, a mod loader, or another app reads directly, since this
 * changes the on-disk format from plain text to a Zstd frame.
 *
 * Safe to introduce on top of an existing plain-text cache with no migration step: a pre-update
 * plain-JSON file fed to [readCompressed] won't match Zstd's frame magic and will throw, so the
 * caller's existing "cache load failed, treat as empty/cold" fallback naturally handles it - the
 * cache just rebuilds once, in the new compressed format, on the first run after updating.
