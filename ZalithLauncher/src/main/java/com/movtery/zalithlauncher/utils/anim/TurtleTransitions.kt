/**
 * The one place the launcher's screen transitions are defined.
 *
 * Before this, every fragment hardcoded its own pair of [Animations] (about 33 of them, split
 * between `BounceIn*` on the way in and `FadeOut*` on the way out), so there was no way to
 * change the feel of the launcher without editing three dozen files - and zoom was impossible
 * entirely, because the animation library had no zoom animators.
 *
 * Everything that animates a screen or a panel now asks this class for its enter/exit
 * animation instead, so the two Settings pickers (Launcher settings -> Animation) actually
 * apply app-wide.

     * 1. The user turned animations off (or turned the speed down to 0) in Settings.

     * 3. **The system says no.** If ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE is 0 - which is exactly what
     *    Settings -> Accessibility -> "Remove animations" sets, and a common thing to do
     *    on a low-end phone - then the platform has already told us not to animate. It
     *    governs every Animator on the device, so it is the authoritative answer.

     *    matter: forcing motion on someone who asked for none is genuinely unpleasant.

     * system service), so their results are cached - they don't change at runtime except by
