/**
 * TurtleLauncher battery-aware performance profiles.
 *
 * Rather than reading raw battery percentage and guessing a threshold, this reads
 * whether Android's own Battery Saver is currently on (PowerManager.isPowerSaveMode,
 * API 21+) - the OS-level signal the user (or the OS's automatic low-battery
 * trigger) has already decided the device should conserve power right now.
 * [AutoSettingsOptimizer] treats this the same way it treats thermal throttling:
 * cap the FPS-boost profile instead of maximizing frame rate on a device that's
 * explicitly trying to save power.
