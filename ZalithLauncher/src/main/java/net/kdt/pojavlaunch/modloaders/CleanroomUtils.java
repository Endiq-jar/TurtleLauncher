/**
 * Cleanroom (https://github.com/CleanroomMC/Cleanroom) is a modernized Forge fork -
 * unlike Forge/NeoForge/Fabric, it targets ONLY Minecraft 1.12.2, nothing else. There
 * is no Maven repo for it (unlike ForgeUtils), so versions come from GitHub's own
 * Releases API instead.
 *
 * IMPORTANT CAVEAT (from Cleanroom's own README, not guessed): "Only MultiMC-based
 * launchers are officially supported... because of the limit on removing vanilla
 * libraries in other launchers." TurtleLauncher is not MultiMC-based. This class
 * downloads the real installer jar Cleanroom publishes, but whether that installer
 * actually runs correctly through this launcher's install pipeline is UNVERIFIED -
 * Cleanroom's own docs describe this installer-jar path as a fallback that's mainly
 * tested against the vanilla Mojang launcher, not launchers like this one.
